Once compiled, use AbiCloud.html (instead of the autogenerated one by Flex Compiler) located in this directory to launch the application, in order to use 
Full Screen and to allow the Application to get the focus from the Web browser.
It is not recommended to launch the application directy from the compiled SWF file, 
without using AbiCloud.html to load the SWF into the Web browser

Application's configuration file is located in /config/client-config.xml
